# Docusaurus Design Tasks Generation

## Prompt

Based on the newly created Implementation Plan (`specs/1-docusaurus-design/impl/plan.md`), please generate the Task List.

Ensure the tasks are broken down into:
1.  **Phase 1: Configuration** (docusaurus.config.js updates).
2.  **Phase 2: Theming Engine** (Creating the variables in custom.css).
3.  **Phase 3: Component Design** (Hero Section & Glassmorphism effects).

I want granular tasks so we can verify the "Electric Blue" look step-by-step.

## Response

Created a comprehensive task list in `specs/1-docusaurus-design/tasks.md` with:

- Phase 1: Configuration tasks for docusaurus.config.js updates
- Phase 2: Theming Engine tasks for creating color variables in custom.css
- Phase 3: Component Design tasks for hero section and glassmorphism effects
- Additional phases for advanced styling and testing/validation
- Granular tasks numbered T001-T046 with clear file paths and dependencies
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- MVP scope defined (T001-T017 for basic functionality)
- User story labels (US1, US2, US3) for tracking

The task list follows the required checklist format and is organized to verify the Electric Blue look step-by-step as requested.
