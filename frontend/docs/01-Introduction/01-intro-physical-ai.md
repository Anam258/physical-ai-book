# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital artificial intelligence to **embodied intelligence** that interacts with the real world. Unlike digital AI systems that operate purely in virtual environments, *Physical AI* encompasses robots and intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act in three-dimensional space.

## Digital vs Physical AI

Digital AI systems operate in predictable, discrete environments where variables are well-defined and controllable. *Physical AI*, however, must navigate the complexities of the real world with its continuous dynamics, sensor noise, and unpredictable environmental factors.

### Key Challenges in Physical AI

:::tip Key Concept
The reality gap refers to the difference between simulated environments and the real world, often causing models trained in simulation to fail when deployed on actual hardware.

The transition from simulation to reality presents numerous challenges:

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors (cameras, lidars, IMUs) to create a coherent understanding of the environment
- **Real-time Processing**: Making decisions within strict timing constraints to ensure safety and responsiveness
- **Uncertainty Management**: Handling noisy sensor data and uncertain environmental conditions

## Applications of Physical AI

Physical AI finds applications across diverse domains including manufacturing automation, healthcare robotics, autonomous vehicles, and domestic service robots. Each application presents unique requirements and constraints that shape the AI system design.
