# Docusaurus Design Implementation Plan

## Prompt

Create an implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook frontend design with these requirements:

- Theme: "Electric Blue & Dark Mode First" with futuristic Robotics color palette
- Primary Color: Electric Blue/Cyan
- Background: Deep Navy/Black
- Implement "Glassmorphism" (blur effects) for the Navbar and Sidebar
- Add hover effects on cards (glow/lift)
- Create a "Hero Section" with a Gradient Text Headline
- Add a "Feature Grid" showing the 14 Weeks structure clearly
- Focus heavily on custom.css and index.js to achieve high-end look

## Response

Created a comprehensive implementation plan with:

- Technical context defining the futuristic Robotics theme
- Constitution compliance check ensuring adherence to project principles
- Gates verification for architecture, technology, and quality standards
- Research document with decisions on color palette, glassmorphism, gradient text, and feature grid
- Data model defining color variables, component styles, and layout components
- Quickstart guide with step-by-step instructions for implementing the design
- All artifacts organized in specs/1-docusaurus-design/impl/ directory

The plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing the Electric Blue & Dark Mode theme with glassmorphism effects, gradient text, and feature grid as requested.
