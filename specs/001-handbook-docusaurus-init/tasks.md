# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook - Part 1 Focus

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-handbook-docusaurus-init/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No explicit test tasks are requested in the feature specification, so test tasks will not be generated in detail. However, basic build/serve verification is included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Docusaurus structure

- [X] T001 Initialize Docusaurus v3 project with TypeScript in current folder: `npm init docusaurus@latest . classic --typescript`
- [X] T002 Install project dependencies: `npm install`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Docusaurus Structure)

**Purpose**: Core Docusaurus content and asset directories.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T003 Ensure `docs/` directory exists for chapters
- [X] T004 Ensure `static/` directory exists for static assets
- [X] T005 Create custom CSS directory: `src/css/`
- [X] T006 Create custom CSS file: `src/css/custom.css`

**Checkpoint**: Docusaurus foundation ready for content and customization.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Browse Handbook Content (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Users can easily browse the chapters of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through the deployed Docusaurus site and observing chapter content and sidebar navigation.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 1: `docs/01-week-1-introduction.md`
- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 2: `docs/02-week-2.md`
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 3: `docs/03-week-3.md`
- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 4: `docs/04-week-4.md`
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 5: `docs/05-week-5.md`
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 6: `docs/06-week-6.md`
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 7: `docs/07-week-7.md`
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 8: `docs/08-week-8.md`

- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 10: `docs/10-week-10.md`
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 11: `docs/11-week-11.md`
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 12: `docs/12-week-12.md`
- [ ] T019 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Week 13: `docs/13-week-13-advanced-topics.md`
- [ ] T020 [P] [US1] Create chapter file for Capstone Project: `docs/14-capstone-project.md`
- [ ] T021 [US1] Configure `sidebars.ts` for autogenerated sidebar from `docs/` directory: `sidebars.ts`
- [ ] T022 [US1] Run Docusaurus development server to verify basic navigation: `npm run start`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 (Browse Handbook Content) should be fully functional and testable independently.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Handbook on Mobile (P1)

**Goal**: Users can view the handbook content on mobile devices with a responsive and easy-to-read layout.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the deployed Docusaurus site on a mobile device or using browser developer tools and verifying responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T023 [US2] Configure `docusaurus.config.ts` to support mobile responsiveness (e.g., adjust theme configuration, add custom viewport settings).
- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Add custom CSS rules to `src/css/custom.css` for mobile-specific layout adjustments, hero section, and footer styling.
- [ ] T025 [US2] Verify mobile design and responsiveness by running `npm run start` and inspecting in mobile view.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 (View Handbook on Mobile) should be fully functional and testable.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Access Handbook Online (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Users can access the handbook online via GitHub Pages without complex setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the deployed GitHub Pages URL and verifying the Docusaurus site loads correctly and is fully functional.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [US3] Configure `docusaurus.config.ts` for GitHub Pages deployment (set `baseUrl`, `projectName`, `organizationName`, `deploymentBranch`).
- [ ] T027 [US3] Build the Docusaurus site for production: `npm run build`
- [ ] T028 [US3] Test the built site locally: `npm run serve`
- [ ] T029 [US3] Deploy the site to GitHub Pages: `GIT_USER=<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME> USE_SSH=true npm run deploy`
- [ ] T030 [US3] Verify the handbook is accessible at the live GitHub Pages URL.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 (Access Handbook Online) should be fully functional and testable. All core features for Part 1 are now deployed.

---

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and overall quality.

- [ ] T031 Review `research.md` for MDX best practices and apply any missing elements to chapters (e.g., custom components, advanced styling).
- [ ] T032 Review `research.md` for code block best practices and apply any missing elements to chapters (e.g., specific language highlighting, line numbering, copy buttons configuration).
- [ ] T033 Perform a comprehensive end-to-end review of the deployed site for overall visual quality, navigation, and content accuracy.
- [ ] T034 Commit all pending changes with a descriptive message: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Completed Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook Part 1 deployment"`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion.
  - User stories can then proceed sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3).
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories.
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable.
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable.

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks are ordered sequentially as listed.
- Core implementation tasks should precede testing or verification steps where dependencies exist.

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T001 and T002 are largely sequential due to `npm init` and `npm install`.
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Content Creation)**: Tasks T007-T020 (creating individual chapter files) are highly parallelizable. Multiple team members could create different chapters concurrently.
- **Across User Stories**: Once the Foundational phase (Phase 2) is complete, User Stories 1, 2, and 3 are all marked as Priority P1 and could theoretically be worked on in parallel by different team members. However, due to the tight interdependencies (e.g., US2 building on US1's content, US3 deploying the complete site), a sequential approach is recommended for a single developer or small team for Day 1 MVP.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Content Creation)

```bash
# Example of parallelizing chapter creation (T007-T020)
# Developer A:
Task: "Create chapter file for Week 1: docs/01-week-1-introduction.md"
Task: "Create chapter file for Week 2: docs/02-week-2.md"

# Developer B:
Task: "Create chapter file for Week 3: docs/03-week-3.md"
Task: "Create chapter file for Week 4: docs/04-week-4.md"

# And so on for other chapters.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 & Core Deployment)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T002)
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T003-T006)
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T007-T022) - Focus on basic content and navigation.
4.  Complete core deployment tasks from Phase 5 (T026-T030) to get a deployable book online.
5.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 and initial deployment independently. Deploy/demo if ready.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready.
2.  Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!).
3.  Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo.
4.  Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo.
5.  Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1.  Team completes Setup + Foundational together.
2.  Once Foundational is done:
    *   Developer A: User Story 1 (Content Creation and basic sidebar)
    *   Developer B: User Story 2 (Mobile responsiveness and design)
    *   Developer C: User Story 3 (GitHub Pages configuration and deployment)
3.  Stories complete and integrate independently. Coordination for `docusaurus.config.ts` modifications would be crucial.

## Notes

-   [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-   [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
-   Each user story should be independently completable and testable
-   Commit after each task or logical group
-   Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
-   Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
