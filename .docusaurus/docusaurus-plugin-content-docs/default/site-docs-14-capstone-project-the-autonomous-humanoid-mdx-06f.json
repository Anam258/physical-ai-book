  "description": "\\n\\n## Learning Objectives\\n Integrate all learned modules to create a full voice-to-action pipeline for a humanoid robot.\\n Implement advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms.\\n Develop robust object manipulation capabilities.\\n Demonstrate autonomous behavior in complex environments.\\n\\n## Prerequisites & Hardware Checklist\\n Software Digital Twin workstation, NVIDIA Jetson Orin (for deployment), RealSense camera, optional End-to-End Autonomous Humanoid System\\n Code\\n     Voice command processing (Whisper + GPT).\\n     High-level action planning.\\n     Low-level motion control (kinematics, dynamics).\\n     Perception (VSLAM, object detection).\\n     Navigation (path planning, obstacle avoidance).\\n     Manipulation (grasping, object placement).\\n Activity A simulated (or physical) humanoid robot successfully performing a multi-step autonomous task based on voice commands.\\n\\n## Sim-to-Real Bridge\\n Concept: The capstone project emphasizes the complete sim-to-real workflow, from developing and testing complex behaviors in simulation to deploying and validating them on real humanoid hardware.\\n\\n## Quiz / Reflection Questions\\n1. What are the main challenges in integrating multiple AI and robotics components into a single autonomous system?\\n2. How would you design a robust error recovery mechanism for an autonomous humanoid?\\n3. Propose an advanced task for the autonomous humanoid beyond object manipulation.\\n",
