# Docusaurus Design Specification Creation

## Prompt

Create a specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook frontend configuration and design with these requirements:

- Configure and Design a visually stunning, unique, and professional Docusaurus handbook
- Use a custom color scheme (e.g., Deep Blue & Electric Purple) instead of default green
- Theme: Modern, Tech-Focused, Professional
- Vibe: "Future of Robotics"
- Update docusaurus.config.js with Title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
- Set Tagline: "The Future of Embodied Intelligence"
- Setup GitHub Pages settings correctly
- Edit custom.css to override default colors

## Response

Created a comprehensive specification document at specs/1-docusaurus-design/spec.md with:

- Functional requirements for configuration and visual overhaul
- User scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Key entities and dependencies
- A quality checklist at specs/1-docusaurus-design/checklists/requirements.md

The specification outlines requirements for updating the Docusaurus configuration with the correct title and tagline, implementing a custom color scheme with Deep Blue and Electric Purple, and ensuring a professional, tech-focused design that reflects the "Future of Robotics" theme. All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic.
