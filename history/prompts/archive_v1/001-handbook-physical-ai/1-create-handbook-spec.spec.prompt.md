# Create Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook Specification

## Prompt Text

# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Handbook – Part 1 (100 base points)

**Goal TODAY**: Deploy a perfect Docusaurus v3 textbook with **exactly 14 chapters** matching the official Panaversity hackathon curriculum.

**EXACT 14 CHAPTERS (must match this — no generic titles)**:

1. Weeks 1–2: Introduction to Physical AI
2–4. Weeks 3–5: ROS 2 Fundamentals (3 chapters)
5–6. Weeks 6–7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity (2 chapters)
7–9. Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (3 chapters)
10–11. Weeks 11–12: Humanoid Robot Development (2 chapters)
12. Week 13: Conversational Robotics
13. Hardware Requirements & Lab Setup
14. Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

**Every chapter MUST contain**:
* Learning Objectives
* Prerequisites & Hardware Checklist
* Hands-on Labs with **real runnable ROS 2 / Isaac Sim code**
* Sim-to-Real Bridge section
* Quiz / Reflection questions

**Success Criteria (measurable)**:
* SC-001: All 14 chapters exist and
